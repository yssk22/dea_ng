# dea_ng

This repository contains the code for the Droplet Execution Agent (DEA)
and related components.

## Components

### DEA

The DEA itself is written in Ruby and takes care of managing an
application instance's lifecycle. It can be instructed by the [Cloud
Controller][cc] to start and stop application instances. It keeps track
of all started instances, and periodically broadcasts messages about
their state over [NATS][nats] (meant to be picked up by the [Health
Manager][hm]).

The advantages of this generation of the DEA over the previous (and
first) generation DEA is that is more modular and has better test
coverage. A breaking change between the two is that this version of the
DEA depends on Warden to run application instances.

### Directory server

The directory server is written in Go and can be found in the `go/`
directory. It is a replacement for the older directory server that was
embedded in the DEA itself.

Requests for directories/files are handled by the DEA, which responds
with a HTTP redirect to a URL that hits the directory server directly.
The URL is signed by the DEA, and the directory server checks the
validity of the URL with the DEA before serving it.
